My Quick-And-Dirty [Exercism](http://exercism.io) Solutions
-----------------------------------------------------------

I started playing with the [Java](http://exercism.io/languages/java) exercises. I am planning to do exercises in other languages like [OCaml](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml) and [Python](http://exercism.io/languages/python), but maybe later, when I am done with the Java ones.

My solutions are quick-and-dirty because I focus only on passing the provided tests. I don't mind about performance or speed, or scalability, or about idiomatic code, or about adding other tests to those already provided. I don't even bother putting too many comments in the code. And I don't submit my solutions to the exercism site.

As usual when programming, there is more than one possible solution for a particular problem, but I only keep one of them. It may not be the best solution when it comes to speed, etc., but once again, this is quick-and-dirty stuff.

As a side note, I found myself using a functional language style when writing Java code. For example, instead of using a typical `for` loop, I tend to use the `forEach` method when/if possible. Also, some lambda expressions here and there. Why not?
